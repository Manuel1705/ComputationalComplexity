\section{Cryptography}
The cryptographic functions to encrypt and decrypt messages used today are not scure in the absolute sense. They are based on mathematical functions that are easy to compute in one direction, but hard to compute in the other direction. It could be possibile to break the security even without knowing the key. The security of the system is based on the fact that finding the key is computationally infeasible in a reasonable time. The problem of breaking the cipher belong to a complexity class that is strictly bigger than P. Encrypting and decrypting a message are not decision problems, so they belong to a specific complexity class. The existing condition of the cryptographic function is not related to the $P\not= NP$ hypothesis but on the hypothesis that $P\not= UP$, where $UP$ is a subclass of $NP$.
